   <p class="text-p">The goal of Daky in Monsterland is to survive for as long as possible (measured in waves of monsters) while accumulating as many points as possible by destroying said monsters. So how do you do this?</p>
 </div>
 <div class="row">
   <p class="text-p">During play, you can move Daky <span><img src="assets/spritedakyfront" alt=""></span>, one space at a time, using the arrows provided. After each move Daky makes, the monsters will move one space toward him. Luckily, however, the monsters are stupid, and will pursue Daky without regard for their own safety, and that's how you beat them. If two or more monsters collide while chasing Daky, they'll be destroyed, and, better still, they'll leave a pile of bones on the playing field which is also deadly to other monsters (...and Daky).</p>
 </div>
 <div class="row">
   <p class="text-p">Sometimes, though, you'll get caught in a no-win situation, and no matter what move you make, you'll be caught. Fortunately, you have a couple of other options. Once per wave, Daky and belch forth fire, which will destroy all monsters in the eight spaces surrounding him. If you survive a wave without using your fire-breath, you keep it, so the number of times you can use it is cumulative. Out of fire-breath? Stuck in a hopeless situation? Take to the skies! Daky can fly... sort of. He's not very good at it, so while you can take off as often as you like, Daky has no control over where he lands, which means you might land and immediately be eaten by a monster, or even land directly ON a monster or bone-pile, but a chance to survive is better than no chance, and sometimes, rolling the dice, flexing wings, and playing the odds is the best thing you can do.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="row">
   <p class="text-p">Finally, each time you clear all the monsters, the board will reset: all the bone piles will go away, Daky will return to his starting spot, and more monsters will spawn... and I do mean more. Each wave brings with it an increasingly large number of monsters. Have fun, and good luck!</p>
